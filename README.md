# Certificate Service

This is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing certificates.  It allows for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting certificate records.

## Functionality

The Certificate Service provides the following functionalities:

* **Get All Certificates:** Retrieve a list of all certificates.
* **Get Certificate by ID:** Retrieve a specific certificate by its unique ID.
* **Create Certificate:** Create a new certificate record.
* **Update Certificate:** Update an existing certificate record.
* **Delete Certificate:** Delete a certificate record.
* **Get Certificates by Student Name:** Retrieve all certificates associated with a particular student name.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The primary programming language used.
* **Spring Boot:**  Framework for building the application.
* **Spring Data JPA:** For database interaction.
* **RESTful API:**  For communication with clients.
* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Enabled for `http://localhost:4200`.  This allows a frontend application running on this origin to communicate with the backend.
* **In-Memory Database (Likely H2):**  While not explicitly stated, the lack of database configuration suggests the application likely uses an in-memory database like H2 for simplicity.  For production, you'll want to configure a persistent database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

* **`Certificate.java`:**  The entity class representing a certificate.
* **`CertificateController.java`:** The REST controller handling API requests.
* **`CertificateRepository.java`:** The JPA repository for database operations.
* **`CertificateService.java`:** The service layer containing the business logic.
* **`CertificateServiceApplication.java`:** The main application class.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
2. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
3. **Build the project:** `mvn clean install`
4. **Run the application:** `mvn spring-boot:run`

The application will start on port 8080 by default.

Future Enhancements

Database Configuration: Configure a persistent database for production use.

Input Validation: Add input validation to ensure data integrity.

Security: Implement security measures (e.g., authentication, authorization).

Error Handling: Improve error handling and provide more informative error messages.

Testing: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.
